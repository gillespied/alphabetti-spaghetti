# alphabetti-spaghetti
A panagram puzzle

I really like playing spelling bee from the NYT, but I'm often bothered:
- I can't play in British English.
- I can't play more than one a day.
- Their editor chooses words that are in the valid dictionary completely at random.
- I can't look up what the words mean easily.
- I have to wait for hints till America has woken up and written them.

I intend to solve these problems in this alphabetti-spaghetti, the tomato noodle based alternative.
- Build the game with a british english dictionary, but allow other dictionaries to be loaded.
- Have a button to play a random word.
- Think of some rules based on popularity for inclusion. (or make obscure words score more).
- include a lookup to a dictionary api.
- Trial using an LLM to generate hints for the words.

I also plan to have a mode where multiple people can play on the same grid. A mode where you can have a timer on the grid to promote competitive solving. A wrong word counter, to promote accurate solving and reduce brutefoce attacks. I'm going to keep the genius rating though as that makes me feel good about myself.
